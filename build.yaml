# For the standard ErgoDox Wireless dongle setup with the latest Raytac "green"
# dongle, you do not need to modify this file. If you are using a different
# dongle such as the older Raytac "blue" dongle, you will need to modify
# "board". For a dongleless setup, you will need to modify both "board" and
# "shield". Please see "readme.md" for more details.
